  "body": "# Caffe Installation \r\n\r\nThe step by step processes of caffe installation in Ubuntu(14.04) is provided here. \r\n\r\n## Hardware & cuda version\r\nThe following installation has been implemented and successfully tested on [CUDA 8.0](http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2016/webinar/cuda-8-features-overview.pdf) and [NVIDIA TITAN X(Pwered by Pascal) GPU](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/10series/titan-x-pascal).\r\n\r\n## CUDA installation\r\n\r\nFor the [NVIDIA TITAN X(Pwered by Pascal) GPU](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/10series/titan-x-pascal), installing CUDA 8.0 is necessary. The CUDA 8.0 download file and installation procedure can be found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads). The system platform has to be chosen as the following image: ![](Images/Select Target Platform.png).\r\n\r\nFirst using the terminalgo to the folder that the downloaded \".deb\" file is located. Now the installation has to be done as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404-8-0-local_8.0.44-1_amd64.deb\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install cuda\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that, the described procedure is the straight-forward approach of installing CUDA. Issues like \"black screen\", \"stuck in login page\" and other incompatibilities may happen which are beyond the scope of this documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Preinstallation and CUDA compatibility\r\nNow the assumption is that the [CUDA](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/#axzz4MnU6Gq6E) is already installed.\r\n\r\nCheck the supporting GPU(s) and Ubuntu version using the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlspci | grep -i nvidia\r\nuname -m && cat /etc/*release\r\n gcc --version\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Install dependencies\r\nCaffe has different dependencies which are required by its structure. In the following subsections an abstract list of these dependencies and the commands for installing them are provided. Depending on the available installed packages on the system, more or less dependencies might be required.\r\n\r\nThe Caffe installation in this documentation uses the build-in python of the Ubuntu-Trusty(14.04). However Anaconda-based installation can be performed but it is not required as for the moment it has more incompatibilies and may make the installation more complicated.\r\n\r\n### Installing git, BLAS and unzip\r\nBLAS can be used as the backend of matrix and vector computations of Caffe. There are different implementations of this library. [OpenBLAS](http://www.openblas.net/) has been chosed. \r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev git unzip\r\n```\r\nAlternatively you can refer to [OpenBLAS repository](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS).\r\n\r\n### Install OpenCV\r\nThe [OpenCV](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenCV) is the well-known open-source computer vision library.\r\n\r\nThere are three suggested way for installing OpenCV.\r\n\r\n1. Install directly by going to [this link](https://github.com/astorfi/Caffe_Framework/tree/master/Installation/OpenCV_Installation) and using one of the \"OpenCV.sh\" or \"OpenCV_Alternative.sh\" bash script files available in this repository.\r\n\r\n* The second file is more abstract and installs less dependancies. This may lead to have less conflicts and incompatibilties.\r\n\r\n2. Install as follows for the particular version:\r\n```\r\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jayrambhia/Install-OpenCV/master/Ubuntu/2.4/opencv2_4_9.sh\r\nchmod +x opencv2_4_9.sh \r\n./opencv2_4_9.sh\r\n```\r\n* The first two files are the edited version of the second method.\r\n\r\n3. Install using the source from the [source](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html)\r\n\r\n### Install other dependecies(Boost,...)\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev\r\nsudo apt-get install libprotobuf-dev libleveldb-dev libsnappy-dev libopencv-dev libboost-all-dev libhdf5-serial-dev\r\nsudo apt-get install libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev liblmdb-dev protobuf-compiler\r\nsudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Install protobuf\r\n\r\nFor protobuf installation, simple pip installation is recommended.\r\n```\r\npip install protobuf\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Clone and Install Caffe from Source\r\nIn this phase, the Caffe repository must be cloned and install.\r\nCreate a directory named \"Caffe\":\r\n```\r\nmkdir Caffe\r\ncd Caffe\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the repository must be cloned:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake a copy of \"Makefile.config.example\" under the new name of \"\"Makefile.config\" to be modified if necessary.\r\n```\r\ncp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config\r\n```\r\nFor makking any modification the \"Makefile.config\" must be opened. Here's are few possible modifications:\r\n\r\n* The CuDNN can be activated using the assigned flag.\r\n* Instead of Python, Anaconda can be used by changing the associated paths.\r\n* The default is using GPU but if the \"CPU_ONLY := 1\" is activated, then there is no GPU support!\r\n\r\nIn the end we can compile and make all the test files:\r\n```\r\nmake all\r\nmake test\r\nmake runtest\r\n```\r\nThen it might be necessary to copy appropriete files be copied in order to prevent [this issue](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/1463).\r\n```\r\nsudo cp libhdf5_hl.so.7 libhdf5_hl.so.8\r\nsudo cp libhdf5.so.7 libhdf5.so.8\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",
